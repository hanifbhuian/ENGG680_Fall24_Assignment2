Summary of Assignment 2:
This assignment explored Least Squares Estimation (LSE) through polynomial curve fitting and 3D satellite positioning. Both unweighted and weighted fits were examined, showing how weighting observations based on noise improves accuracy. LSE was also used to estimate 3D receiver positions, demonstrating how iterative corrections reduce position errors. The assignment highlighted the practical application of LSE and the balance between model complexity and accuracy.
